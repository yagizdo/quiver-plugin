# Previous Session Handover

## Handover Files
```
!`ls -1t .claude/handovers/ 2>/dev/null; true`
```

---

## Instructions

Using the file listing above, determine which branch applies:

### Branch A — No Files
If the listing shows an error (e.g., "No such file or directory"), is empty, or contains **no `.md` files**:
> No handover files found for this project.
> This is a fresh session — no previous context to load.
> **Tip:** `/quiver:handover` at end of session to start tracking.

**Stop here.**

### Branch B — Files Exist
If there are **one or more `.md` files**:
1. The **first `.md` file** in the listing is the most recent (sorted newest-first).
   Read it using the Read tool at path `.claude/handovers/{filename}`.
2. Present it using the output template below.
3. If more than one `.md` file exists, append: "{count} older handover(s) also available."

---

## Output Template

After reading the handover file, present this summary:

> **Session loaded:** `{filename}`
> **Date:** {date extracted from timestamp in filename}
> **Top Priority:** {first item from Next Steps section}

If the handover has no "Next Steps" section or it says "N/A", set Top Priority to "No next steps recorded" and ask the user what they'd like to focus on.

Then:
1. Confirm you understand the current state of the project.
2. List all Next Steps with their priority order and a short explanation of each.
3. Ask the user which one they'd like to work on.

> **Tip:** `/quiver:handover` at end of session to save your progress.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't** dump the raw handover contents without a summary header — always lead with the output template.
- **Don't** auto-start the first Next Step without asking — always present the list and let the user choose.
- **Don't** read older handover files unless the user explicitly requests it.

---

## Verification

- Confirm the file read succeeded (non-empty content returned).
- If the file content looks malformed (no section headings, empty body), warn: "This handover may be incomplete — proceeding with available context."
- Confirm the output template was fully populated — no raw `{placeholder}` text remains in your response.
