# Clear All Handovers

## Handover Files
```
!`ls -1t .claude/handovers/ 2>/dev/null; true`
```

---

## Instructions

Using the file listing above, determine which branch applies:

### Branch A — No Files
If the listing shows an error (e.g., "No such file or directory"), is empty, or contains **no `.md` files**:
> No handover files found — nothing to purge.
> **Tip:** `/quiver:handover` to create one.

**Stop here.**

### Branch B — Files Exist
If there are **one or more `.md` files**:
1. List the pre-deletion inventory:
   > **Files to delete ({count}):**
   > {bulleted list of all .md filenames}
2. Ask the user using the `AskUserQuestion` tool with these actions:
   - Question: "Delete all {count} handover file(s)? This cannot be undone."
   - Actions: `["Yes, delete all", "Cancel"]`
3. **Only proceed if the user selects "Yes, delete all".** If cancelled, stop and output:
   > **Cancelled** — no files were deleted.
4. Delete them all using the Bash tool:
   ```
   rm -f .claude/handovers/*.md
   ```
5. **Memory cleanup:** Read the auto-memory file (`MEMORY.md` in your memory directory). Remove entries under `## Pending Work` and any session-specific context (e.g., "Phase N complete", "blocked on X", in-progress task references, branch work status) using the Edit tool so stale context doesn't carry over. After cleanup, inform the user:
   > Also removed {N} handover-sourced references from MEMORY.md (e.g., pending work items, session context).
   If no matching entries were found, skip this message.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't** delete without listing the inventory first — the user needs to see what will be removed.
- **Don't** skip confirmation — bulk deletion is irreversible and must be explicitly approved.
- **Don't** proceed if the directory doesn't exist — report "nothing to purge" and stop.

---

## Output Template

After deletion, output:

> **Purged:** {count} handover file(s)
> **Files deleted:** {comma-separated filenames}
> **Status:** Clean slate.
> **Tip:** `/quiver:handover` to start fresh tracking, `/quiver:load-handover` to verify.

---

## Verification

Re-list `.claude/handovers/` after deletion to confirm no `.md` files remain. If the directory is now empty, confirm: "Directory clean — 0 handover files."
