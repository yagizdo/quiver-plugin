## How It Works

- **Session handovers** — structured summaries of your work: git state, decisions made, current progress, and planned next steps
- **Auto-save on compact** — PreCompact hook captures context automatically before Claude compacts the conversation
- **Retention policy** — keeps the 3 most recent handovers, prunes older ones automatically
- **Agent orchestration** — discover your local and plugin agents, assemble teams, and run subtasks in parallel
- **Agent scaffolding** — create new agents interactively with smart defaults and best practices
