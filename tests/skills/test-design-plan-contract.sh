#   producer  skills/design/SKILL.md        -- declares the schema, once
#   consumer  skills/design-build/SKILL.md  -- reads a subset, with defaults
#
# Every contract in this repo that a consumer restated has drifted. This test fails
# mechanically when a field moves, a fence is duplicated, or a default goes undocumented.
#
# The field list is read out of the consumer's own defaults table rather than hardcoded
# here, so adding a field to that table without adding it to the producer's fence fails
# this test with no edit to it.
#
# Every assertion reads a skill file. None writes a fixture and greps it with a rule
# hardcoded here -- that form passes whatever the skills say, which is the opposite of a
# drift guard.

# Run directly: bash tests/skills/test-design-plan-contract.sh
