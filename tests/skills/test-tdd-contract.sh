# Three drifts are silent. A restatement copy that drifts stops telling the subagent that a
# test it never saw fail, or a red line naming a test it did not write, is not red evidence --
# the prompt still reads as an ordinary test-first instruction, so nothing looks wrong. A
# consumer that stops naming the producer has nothing left to read at its build step and
# re-grows its own cycle text on the next edit, and that copy then drifts from the producer's
# with nothing raising an error. A re-grown five-step list in /plan puts the exact test code
# back inside the plan, which no reader notices because the plan still talks about tests.
# None of the three changes anything a reader would see, so every assertion reads the live
# files. No fixture is written and grepped with a rule hardcoded here.
