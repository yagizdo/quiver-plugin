# Binds R10 in .claude/rules/skill-rules.md to the two things that depend on it:
#   the frontmatter of every skill under skills/, and the routing block that
#   hooks/scripts/session-start-auto-dispatch.sh builds out of that frontmatter.
#
# R10's failure mode is silent in both directions, which is why it needs a test at all.
# The hook reads the first `when-to-use:` line of the frontmatter and strips `"`, `<`
# and `>` from it. A multi-line YAML block scalar therefore parses to `|` (a routing
# entry reading `/plan: |`, which routes nothing) or to the empty string (the skill is
# dropped from the block entirely). Neither raises an error, neither is visible in a
# session, and the only symptom is a skill that stops auto-firing.
#
# The reverse direction matters more. The hook tells the model to invoke a matching skill
# *silently, before any other response*. R10 exempts four internal reference skills, which
# are read by other skills and never invoked at all; giving one a `when-to-use:` string
# wires a non-invocable skill into that path. So this test asserts the exempt skills carry
# no `when-to-use:` rather than treating the field as merely optional for them.
#
# Destructive operations are not exempt and are not kept out this way. They live inside a
# skill carrying `disable-model-invocation: true` behind an AskUserQuestion confirmation --
# `/handover --clear` and `/handover --clear-all` are the case -- and that skill keeps its
# `when-to-use:` under R10's format rules. What keeps the destructive path off the silent
# auto-invocation route is the hook dropping model-disabled skills from the block, which is
# the assertion in Section 4's disabled branch.
#
# A skill is therefore kept out of the routing block for one of two reasons, and they are
# not the same reason. An R10 exemption means the skill has no `when-to-use:` at all. A skill
# with `disable-model-invocation: true` still declares one -- it is slash-invocable and R10
# still governs the string's shape -- but the model cannot invoke it, so a routing entry
# for it instructs the model to do something impossible. Section 4 therefore asserts
# absence for both sets while Section 3 keeps holding the disabled ones to R10's format.
#
# Section 4 runs the real hook instead of re-deriving its parser here. A test that
# re-implements the consumer passes when the copy is right and the consumer is wrong,
# which is the case it exists to catch.
#
# Run directly: bash tests/skills/test-when-to-use-contract.sh
