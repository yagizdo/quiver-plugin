# Guards the two run flags the design pipeline carries, each of which lives in two files
# by construction:
#   producer  skills/design/SKILL.md       -- Step 0.5 defines --auto and --no-commit,
#             Step 8 acts on --no-commit, Step 10 forwards both
#   consumer  skills/design-build/SKILL.md -- Phase 1 parses both, every prompt site ahead
#             of it carries an auto-mode branch, and Phase 3d honors the commit override
#
# The promise the flag makes is negative: after /design Step 8, an auto run asks nothing.
# A prompt site added to /design-build without an auto branch breaks that promise silently
# -- the run stalls waiting on a human who walked away. So the flag token is read out of
# the producer's forwarding line rather than pinned here, and every AskUserQuestion call
# site in the consumer is checked for a guard rather than counted.
#
# Run directly: bash tests/skills/test-design-flag-contract.sh
