# test-component-count-contract.sh
# Binds the tree to every place a component count or component list is written by hand.
#
# Nine numbers and three lists across five files, none of them derived at read time:
#
#   README.md                             `| Hooks | N |`, `| Skills | N |`, `| Agents | N |`
#   README.md                             the `## Hooks` table -- one row per hook
#   CLAUDE.md                             `N skill directories`, `N agent definitions`
#   .opencode/README.md                   `all N user-facing Quiver skills`
#   .opencode/README.md                   the `#### Available skills` table
#   .opencode/README.md                   `Quiver provides N specialist agents`
#   .opencode/README.md                   the `### Agents` @name list
#   .claude/rules/agent-capability-rules.md  `registers all N agents`
#
# All of them drift silently. Nothing in a session reads any of these numbers, so the
# only symptom is a reader believing them. The .opencode skill sentence is the worked
# example: it was wrong by one before it was wrong by three, because the table 19 lines
# below it was edited twice and the sentence was not, and no test looked.
#
# The user-facing skill count is not a constant. It is the directory count minus the
# names `.claude/rules/readme-structure.md` excludes from user-facing docs, so Section 3
# derives it rather than pinning a number. Section 2 binds this file's copy of that
# exclusion list back to the rule text in both directions -- a name dropped here would
# otherwise shrink the expected count to match whatever the docs happen to say, which is
# the failure this test exists to catch, arriving through the test instead of the docs.
#
# readme-structure.md also carries a `| Skills | 16 |` inventory table. That one is a
# formatting example, not a count of this repo, and is deliberately not a site here.
#
# Each numeric site is asserted to appear exactly once. A reworded sentence leaves the
# grep testing nothing, and a second copy is a new drift partner no assertion covers.
#
# Each list is compared by name, not only by length. A length check alone stays green
# when one entry replaces another.
#
# Run directly: bash tests/inventory/test-component-count-contract.sh
