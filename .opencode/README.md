# Quiver for OpenCode

Complete guide for using [Quiver](https://github.com/yagizdo/quiver) with [OpenCode.ai](https://opencode.ai). Quiver is a development lifecycle plugin providing skills for brainstorming, planning, execution, debugging, code review, and session handover, plus specialized agents for review and debugging.

This directory is the OpenCode-specific overlay for Quiver. The plugin entry point is `.opencode/plugins/quiver.js`. Skills, agents, and commands are discoverable through OpenCode's native mechanisms.

## Installation

Clone Quiver and run the install script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yagizdo/quiver.git
cd quiver
./install.sh opencode
```

This symlinks `.opencode/plugins/quiver.js` into `~/.config/opencode/plugins/`,
which OpenCode auto-loads. Restart OpenCode; the plugin registers the skills
directory and the context7 MCP server itself, so no `opencode.json` entry of your
own is needed.

Verify by asking: "Tell me about your Quiver skills"

Run `./install.sh` with no arguments to cover every runtime detected on the
machine: OpenCode is linked, and Claude Code and Codex have their own install
command printed for you to run. `./install.sh --uninstall` removes the symlinks
again; it never touches a real file or directory it did not create.

### Migrating from the git package spec

Earlier releases installed through a git-backed package spec in the `plugin` array
of your `opencode.json`. That spec no longer resolves. Delete the `quiver` entry
from that array, then run `./install.sh opencode` from your clone. Nothing else in
your config needs to change.

## Usage

### Finding Skills

Use OpenCode's native `skill` tool to list all available Quiver skills:

```
use skill tool to list skills
```

### Loading a Skill

```
use skill tool to load brainstorm
```

### Slash Commands

OpenCode 1.16.2+ does not list Quiver skills in its `/` autocomplete menu. The TUI filter in `footer.command.tsx` drops anything with `source: "skill"`, and Quiver skills register with that source, so the picker stays empty. The skills themselves still work, just not through the menu.

Two ways to invoke them:

**Slash prefix.** Type `/brainstorm <idea>`, `/hypothesis-debugging <bug>`, or any other `/skill-name` directly and submit. The `using-quiver` bootstrap teaches the model to match the prefix against each skill's `when-to-use:` frontmatter and load the skill via the `skill` tool. No autocomplete, but the skill runs.

**Plain language.** Describe what you want: "debug this login bug", "brainstorm a todo app", "review my changes". The bootstrap dispatches the matching skill the same way.

The full skill list lives in the `skill` tool. Run `use skill tool to list skills` to see all 18 user-facing Quiver skills.

#### Available skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `advise` | Get a senior opinion on code or a plan, no spec written |
| `brainstorm` | Turn a vague idea into a validated spec |
| `plan` | Research the codebase and produce an implementation plan |
| `work` | Execute a plan task-by-task |
| `ship` | Take a project from description to a working, verified app |
| `design` | Turn a Figma selection into a pixel-exact implementation plan |
| `design-build` | Build a design plan, gating each task on the project's build or tests |
| `review` | Dispatch review agents |
| `senior-review` | Standalone senior developer review |
| `report-check` | Audit a review report for noise and false positives |
| `hypothesis-debugging` | Systematic bug investigation |
| `commit` | Generate a Conventional Commits message |
| `create-pr` | Open a GitHub pull request |
| `handover` | Save session context; `--clear` removes the most recent handover, `--clear-all` resets session history |
| `load-handover` | Resume from the latest handover |
| `create-agent` | Scaffold a new agent |
| `create-agents-md` | Generate an AGENTS.md |
| `repair-skill` | Fix a broken skill |

### Agents

Quiver provides 20 specialist agents. Invoke them with `@agentname`:

- **Review:** `@architecture-strategist`, `@logic-reviewer`, `@waste-detector`, `@stress-tester`, `@security-audit`, `@test-reviewer`, `@developer-experience-auditor`, `@codex-code-reviewer`, `@report-checker`, `@senior-reviewer`
- **Research:** `@best-practices-researcher`, `@project-context-analyst`, `@code-navigator`, `@code-locator`
- **Debug:** `@code-tracer`, `@log-analyzer`, `@regression-finder`, `@environment-checker`, `@fix-reviewer`
- **Workflow:** `@plan-reviewer`

### Personal Skills

Create your own skills in `~/.config/opencode/skills/`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills/my-skill
```

Create `~/.config/opencode/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Use when [condition] - [what it does]
---

# My Skill

[Your skill content here]
```

### Project Skills

Create project-specific skills in `.opencode/skills/` within your project.

**Skill Priority:** Project skills > Personal skills > Quiver skills

## Updating

```bash
git -C /path/to/quiver pull
```

The plugin is a symlink into the clone, so the next OpenCode start runs the new
code. There is no package cache to clear and no version to pin: the checked-out
commit is the installed version. To run an older release, check out its tag in the
clone.

## How It Works

The Quiver OpenCode plugin does five things:

1. **Registers the skills directory** via the `config` hook. The plugin pushes `skills/` (resolved relative to itself) into `config.skills.paths`, so OpenCode discovers every Quiver skill without a config edit. Node and Bun resolve `import.meta.url` through symlinks to the real path, so this lands inside the clone rather than inside `~/.config/opencode/plugins/`.

2. **Registers the context7 MCP server** via the same `config` hook, so documentation lookups work with no `mcp` entry in your own config. A context7 entry you declare yourself wins.

3. **Injects the `using-quiver` bootstrap** via the `experimental.chat.messages.transform` hook. On every new session, the first user message has the `using-quiver` meta-skill prepended, wrapped in `<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>` tags. This establishes the "check for relevant skill before any response" rule, so OpenCode agents invoke Quiver skills automatically.

4. **Preserves Quiver-specific context across compactions** via the `experimental.session.compacting` hook. When OpenCode compacts a session, the Quiver handover context (branch, task, in-progress files, decisions) is included in the compaction prompt.

5. **Logs session lifecycle events** via the `session.created` hook and `client.app.log()` for debugging.

### Tool Mapping

Skills speak in actions rather than naming any one runtime's tools. On OpenCode these resolve to:

- "Create a todo" / "mark complete in todo list" -> `todowrite`
- `Subagent (general-purpose):` -> `task` tool with `subagent_type: "general"` (or `"explore"` for codebase exploration, or a specific Quiver subagent)
- "Invoke a skill" -> OpenCode's native `skill` tool
- "Read a file" -> `read`
- "Create a file" / "edit a file" / "delete a file" -> `apply_patch`
- "Run a shell command" -> `bash`
- "Search file contents" / "find files by name" -> `grep`, `glob`
- "Fetch a URL" -> `webfetch`

## Differences from Claude Code

These Claude Code-specific primitives have no direct equivalent in OpenCode:

### 1. AskUserQuestion (interactive choice buttons)

OpenCode does not have the `AskUserQuestion` tool.

**Replacement:** Present choices as a numbered plain-text list and wait for the user to type their selection number.

### 2. Agent tool (parallel subagent dispatch)

The `Agent` tool for spawning subagents is Claude Code-specific.

**Replacement:** Use `@agentname` mentions to invoke subagents. Multi-agent orchestration (like `/review`) uses OpenCode's `task` tool for sequential subagent dispatch instead of parallel Claude Code subagents.

### 3. Session hooks (PreCompact, SessionStart)

PreCompact and SessionStart hooks do not fire in OpenCode.

**Replacement:** The Quiver OpenCode plugin hooks into `experimental.session.compacting` to inject handover context. Trigger manual handover creation with `/handover` at natural breakpoints or before ending a session.

### 4. Shell injection blocks

Inline shell blocks (`!`command``) work identically in OpenCode. No adaptation needed.

### 5. Frontmatter fields (when-to-use, name)

`when-to-use:` and `name:` fields in skill files are Claude Code-specific.
OpenCode ignores them. No action needed.

### 6. Handover file paths

Handover files write to `.claude/handovers/` relative to the project root.
Unchanged in OpenCode since this is relative to the project root.

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not loading

1. Check OpenCode logs: `opencode run --print-logs "hello" 2>&1 | grep -i quiver`
2. Verify the symlink resolves: `ls -l ~/.config/opencode/plugins/quiver.js`
3. Make sure you're running a recent version of OpenCode

### Skills not found

1. Use OpenCode's `skill` tool to list available skills
2. Check that the plugin is loading (see above)
3. Each skill needs a `SKILL.md` file with valid YAML frontmatter

### Bootstrap not appearing

1. Check OpenCode version supports `experimental.chat.messages.transform` hook
2. Restart OpenCode after config changes
3. If a future OpenCode version removes this hook, skills will still be discoverable but won't auto-activate
