# Quiver

Session handover plugin for Claude Code. Saves and restores conversation context across sessions.
Dependencies: `bash`, `claude` CLI.

## Architecture

- **`.claude-plugin/`** — Plugin manifest (`plugin.json`). Defines name, version, hook and command registration.
- **`commands/`** — Markdown slash commands (currently 4). Each file has a YAML `description` and is a self-contained prompt.
- **`hooks/`** — `hooks.json` registers event hooks; `scripts/` holds their implementations. Currently one hook: PreCompact (fires before context compaction).
- **Storage** — Handover files are written to `<project>/.claude/handovers/`.

## System Behavior

- **Commands** — Markdown files executed by Claude Code. Shell blocks (`` !`…` ``) run inline and inject output into the prompt. Commands cannot call hook scripts directly; they duplicate save/prune logic as Claude instructions.
- **Hooks** — Bash scripts invoked by Claude Code on lifecycle events. The PreCompact hook reads `transcript_path` from stdin JSON (via `sed`), pipes the transcript to `claude -p` for summarization, and writes the result to the handovers directory.
- **SYNC contract** — The 8 handover section headings are defined in two places that must stay identical: `commands/handover.md:86` and `hooks/scripts/pre-compact-handover.sh:25`. Both files contain a `SYNC:` comment pointing to the other. If you change headings, update both and verify line numbers in the comments.

## Development Standards

### Adding a Command

1. Create `commands/<name>.md` with YAML front-matter containing `name` and `description` fields. The `name` field must match the filename (without `.md`) — it enables prefix-free access (e.g., `/handover` instead of `/quiver:handover`).
2. Commands are **prompts**, not scripts. `` !`…` `` blocks gather raw data; the rest of the file is a prompt that tells Claude how to interpret the data, make decisions, and take actions with its own tools. Never write a bare code block without accompanying prompt guidance — marketplace users need commands that work out of the box.
3. Do not use `$()` command substitution, variable assignment, `if/else`, or logic-bearing pipes in `` !`…` `` blocks — Claude Code blocks these in marketplace plugins.
4. Do not reference `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` — it is unavailable in commands.
5. Follow the structural patterns defined in `.claude/templates/command-template-system.md` — role framing, decision trees, output templates, anti-patterns, quality gates, verification steps, and cross-command references.

### Adding an Agent

1. Run `/quiver:create-agent` to scaffold agents interactively -- it handles path, category, and frontmatter automatically.
2. Agents are **persona prompts**, not commands. They define a specialist role that gets spawned as a subagent by commands or directly via the Agent tool.
3. Agents live in `agents/<category>/<name>.md` with YAML front-matter fields: `name`, `description`, `model`.
4. Category directories: `review/`, `research/`, `workflow/`, `design/`, `docs/`, or custom.
5. The `agents/` directory is registered in `plugin.json`'s `skills` array.

### Adding or Modifying a Hook

1. Register the event in `hooks/hooks.json` with `"type": "command"` (the only supported hook type).
2. Place the script in `hooks/scripts/`. Use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (falls back to `pwd`) for the project root.
3. `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is available in `hooks.json` and hook scripts.

### Invariants

- **Retention policy** — Exactly the 3 most recent `.md` files in `.claude/handovers/` are kept. Both the command and hook implement pruning independently.
- **Timestamp format** — Filenames use `date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S'`. This format is lexicographically sortable.

## Testing

- **Commands** — Run the slash command in a Claude Code session and verify output.
- **Hook** — Pipe test JSON to the script:
  ```bash
  echo '{"transcript_path":"/path/to/transcript.json"}' | bash hooks/scripts/pre-compact-handover.sh
  ```
- **Syntax check** — `bash -n hooks/scripts/pre-compact-handover.sh`
- **All commands** — Run each `/quiver:*` slash command in a Claude Code session and verify expected output/side-effects.
