# CLI Overlay Rules

Hard rules and learned lessons for branches that add or modify a CLI overlay (Cursor, Codex CLI, and any CLI added later). These rules lock the architecture invariants of the flattened overlay layout.

For skill authoring rules, see `skill-rules.md`. For review-agent rules, see `review-agent-rules.md`. For agent capability profiles, see `agent-capability-rules.md`.

## Hard Rules

Non-negotiable. Every CLI overlay branch must follow all of these. Violations break the source-of-truth invariant or force duplication.

**OR1. Source-of-truth invariant.** `agents/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` are byte-identical regardless of which CLIs are supported. CLI overlay work must never modify these. Verified by `git diff --stat master...HEAD -- agents/ skills/ hooks/ .claude-plugin/`.

**OR2. Dependency direction.** A CLI's manifest dir or root manifest file references the canonical sources (agents, skills, hooks). The reverse is forbidden: no `requires:`, `platforms:`, or `cli:` field in canonical frontmatter; no conditional branches in skill bodies based on the running CLI. Verified by `grep -rn '\.cursor-plugin\|\.codex-plugin' agents skills hooks` returning no matches.

**OR3. Each CLI has one home.** Cursor's overlay lives entirely inside `.cursor-plugin/`. Future overlays live inside their CLI's native manifest location at the repo root -- a per-CLI directory like `.codex-plugin/`, or a single-file manifest at the root when that is what the CLI reads. Gemini CLI was retired 2026-06-18, so the repo carries no Gemini overlay home. There is no `platforms/<cli>/` parallel home. CLI-specific files (rule files, per-CLI hook variants, per-CLI shims) live next to that CLI's manifest. That rule covers adapters of canonical content, not primitives: a primitive that only one runtime executes stays canonical at the repo root, and only an adapter of canonical content moves into an overlay home. `hooks/hooks.json` is the standing precedent -- it is canonical, lives at the repo root, executes on Claude Code and Cursor, and is inert on the other two. The test is what the file is, not how many CLIs run it. Original content that a single runtime happens to execute is canonical; a rewrite, shim, or translation of canonical content for one CLI is an overlay file.

**OR4. Shared assets live at the repo root.** Logo files, icons, and other shared graphical assets live in `assets/` at the repo root. Each CLI's manifest references its own assets by repo-root-relative path. No per-CLI asset folders.

**OR5. Scaffolding-on-demand.** CLI-specific abstractions are created only when a concrete consumer in the canonical content needs them, not in advance. Specifically:
- **Tool-name maps:** when a skill genuinely fans out to multiple CLIs with different tool names, ship a per-skill `references/<cli>-tools.md` next to that skill. Do not maintain a global per-CLI tool map.
- **Degraded-mode behavior:** when a skill needs a fallback because a CLI lacks a primitive (e.g. `AskUserQuestion`), inline the fallback in the skill body. Do not create a separate polyfill file.
- **Hook variants:** when a CLI's hook contract genuinely differs from `hooks/hooks.json`, ship a parallel `hooks/hooks-<cli>.json` and reference it from that CLI's manifest. Do not modify the canonical hooks file.

**OR6. Branch hygiene.** Each CLI overlay branch is based on `master` (not on a long-lived integration branch). Sequential merges only.

## Learned Lessons

Each lesson comes from a real decision or failure on a previous overlay branch. Add new entries when issues surface.

**LO1. Prefer rule-files or context-injection over forking skills.**
Cursor 2.5+ does not auto-execute Claude Code's inline `` !`<command>` `` shell blocks. The first instinct was to fork skill files into a parallel directory so the forks could be rewritten for Cursor. That was rejected because it violates OR1 -- every fix to a canonical skill would need to be mirrored into N forks, and drift would be inevitable. The accepted solution: ship a Cursor rule file (`.cursor-plugin/rules/quiver-shell-blocks.mdc`, `alwaysApply: true`) that tells the Cursor agent to read those blocks as instructions and execute them via the `Shell` tool. When facing a similar "the CLI does not implement Claude Code behavior X" gap on a future CLI, prefer rule files or context-injection mechanisms (rules/, context files like `AGENTS.md`) over skill duplication.

**LO2. Delete unused scaffolding rather than carrying it forward.**
The first overlay branch shipped `platforms/cursor/{primitives,tool-map,polyfills/}` as forward-looking documentation for abstractions that no agent or skill exercised. Carrying the empty scaffolding forward created the worst of both worlds: documentation no consumer honored, and structure no skill referenced. The flatten refactor (this branch) removed it. Lesson: when reviewing an overlay before merge, audit each file for a current consumer; if none exists, delete and resurrect later when a real need surfaces.

**LO3. A cooldown guard that only resets on success is not a cooldown guard.**
The Codex overlay mapped the handover auto-save hook onto the `Stop` event (fires every turn) instead of a PreCompact-equivalent (fires rarely), guarded by "skip if a handover was saved in the last 10 minutes." The guard checked the last *successful* save's mtime -- if the save kept failing silently (missing `transcript_path` in the Stop payload, or `claude` unresolvable in the hook's shell), no successful save ever landed, so the guard's reference point never existed and the full `claude -p` summarization ran on every single turn instead of once per 10 minutes. This was discovered because the project's `.claude/handovers/` had zero files despite months of Codex use. The Stop-hook mapping was removed entirely (`.codex-plugin/rules/quiver-codex-compat.md` "No auto-save hook" section) rather than patched, since a frequently-firing event with a success-dependent guard is fragile by construction.
*Prevention:* When mapping a Quiver hook onto a CLI event that fires on every turn (Stop, UserPromptSubmit, or similar), any cooldown/guard must be based on an attempt marker written *before* the expensive operation runs, not on the operation's own success artifact. If the guard can't be made attempt-based cheaply, prefer no automatic hook over a frequently-firing one with a fragile guard -- a manual skill invocation is a safe fallback that never silently costs money.
