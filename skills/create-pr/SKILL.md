# Instructions

## Step 0 -- Validate Environment

Silently evaluate the gather-context output. Stop with a clear message on the first failure:

1. If any git block returned `NO_GIT` -> print: `> No git repository detected. /create-pr requires a git repo.` **Stop here.**
2. If `git remote -v` returned `NO_REMOTE` or is empty -> print: `> No remote configured. Add one with \`git remote add origin <url>\`.` **Stop here.**
3. If `git status --short` is not empty -> print: `> You have uncommitted changes. Commit them first -- you can use \`/quiver:commit\`.` **Stop here.**

---

## Step 1 -- Detect Base Branch

Determine the base branch using this priority order. Use the first that resolves:

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--base <value>`, use that value as the base branch.
2. If `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD` did not return `NO_DEFAULT_BRANCH`, strip the `origin/` prefix and use the result.
3. Try `main` -- run `git rev-parse --verify origin/main 2>/dev/null`. If it succeeds, use `main`.
4. Try `master` -- run `git rev-parse --verify origin/master 2>/dev/null`. If it succeeds, use `master`.
5. Try `develop` -- run `git rev-parse --verify origin/develop 2>/dev/null`. If it succeeds, use `develop`.
6. If none resolved, ask the user: "Could not detect the base branch. What branch should this PR target?" via `AskUserQuestion`.

**After resolving the base branch:**

Check if the current branch (from `git branch --show-current`) equals the base branch. If so -> print: `> You are on the base branch (\`{base}\`). Create a feature branch first.` **Stop here.**

Check commits ahead: run `git log --oneline {base}..HEAD`. If output is empty -> print: `> No commits ahead of \`{base}\`. Nothing to create a PR for.` **Stop here.**

---

## Step 2 -- Push If Needed

Before creating the PR, ensure the branch is pushed to the remote:

1. Check upstream: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{upstream} 2>/dev/null`
2. If upstream exists -> `git push`
3. If no upstream -> `git push -u origin {branch}`

If push fails, show the error verbatim and **stop here.**

---

## Step 3 -- Generate PR Title & Body

Gather additional context for PR generation:
- `git log --oneline {base}..HEAD` -- all commits on this branch
- `git diff --stat {base}..HEAD` -- files changed summary
- `git diff {base}..HEAD` -- **full diff** to understand the actual changes in depth

Read the full diff carefully. Understand what was added, modified, and why. Use this understanding to write a PR description that a reviewer can use to evaluate the changes without reading every line of code.

**Title rules:**
- Concise, imperative mood, no period
- <= 72 characters
- Single commit: use its subject line. Multiple commits: summarize the overall theme.

**Body rules:**

The body depth should scale with the PR size:

- **Small PR (1 file or < 50 lines changed):** Summary + Test Plan is sufficient.
- **Medium PR (2-5 files or 50-200 lines):** Add a Changes section with key changes organized by area.
- **Large PR (5+ files or 200+ lines):** Add "How it works" and/or "Design decisions" sections.

**Body template (adapt sections based on PR size):**

```
## Summary

{1-3 sentences explaining what this PR does and WHY it exists -- the motivation, not just a restatement of the diff}

{For medium+ PRs, add bullet points with key changes organized by area:}
- **New file:** `path/to/file` -- what it does
- **Modified:** `path/to/file` -- what changed and why

### How it works

{For large PRs: describe the flow, architecture, or algorithm. Numbered steps work well.}

### Design decisions

{For large PRs with non-obvious choices: use a table or bullet list explaining key decisions.}

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| {what was decided} | {what was chosen} | {why this over alternatives} |

## Test plan

- [ ] {Testing steps or verification checklist}
```

Generate the body from the full diff content, commit history, and diff stats. Write for a reviewer -- explain the *why* and *how*, not just the *what*.

**Language rule:** the title and body are always written in English, regardless of the conversation language. Only use another language if the user explicitly asks for it in this invocation. A PR is a repository artifact read by people who were not in this conversation.

**Structure rule:** the body follows the template above -- `## Summary` first, then the size-appropriate sections. Do not collapse it into one prose paragraph. If a section has nothing to say, drop the section rather than padding it.

---

## Step 4 -- Present & Execute

### Flag: `--draft`

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains "draft", skip the `AskUserQuestion` step. Show the generated title and body, then immediately execute `gh pr create --draft --title "{title}" --body "..." --base {base}`.

### Default (no flag)

**Print the preview to chat first, then ask.** Do not paste the body into the `AskUserQuestion` question field. That field is rendered as a single truncated line by some Claude Code surfaces, so a multi-line body is cut off or dropped entirely and the user is asked to approve something they cannot read.

Print, as normal chat output:

> **PR Title:** {title}
> **Base:** `{base_branch}` <- `{current_branch}`

Then the body verbatim inside a fenced ```markdown block, so the user sees exactly what `gh pr create` will receive.

Then call `AskUserQuestion`:

- **Question:** `"Create this PR?"` -- one short line. No newlines, no body text, no ANSI escape codes.
- **Header:** "Pull Request"
- **Options:**
  1. **Create PR** -- "Create pull request"
  2. **Create as Draft** -- "Create as draft pull request"
  3. **Edit** -- "Revise the title or description"
  4. **Cancel** -- "Abort without creating PR"

---

### Execution

**On "Create PR":**

```
gh pr create --title "{title}" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
{body}
EOF
)" --base {base_branch}
```

**On "Create as Draft":**

Same command with `--draft` appended.

**On "Edit":** Ask what to change, revise the title or body, and re-present the `AskUserQuestion`.

**On "Cancel":**

> **PR creation cancelled.**

**Stop here.**

---

## Step 5 -- Output

After successful PR creation, display:

> **PR Created:** {pr_url}
> **Title:** {title}
> **Branch:** `{current_branch}` -> `{base_branch}`
> **Commits:** {count}
> **Files changed:** {count}

Extract the PR URL from the `gh pr create` output (it prints the URL to stdout).

---

# Error Handling

If `gh pr create` fails, show the error verbatim and suggest the user check:
- GitHub CLI authentication (`gh auth login`)
- Remote repository permissions
- Whether a PR already exists for this branch (`gh pr list --head {branch}`)

Never retry automatically.

---

## Test Plan

**Trigger:** `/create-pr` (or `/create-pr --draft`, `/create-pr --base develop`); `/quiver:create-pr` should also work.

**Setup:**
- Current directory is a git repo with a remote configured, the working tree is clean, and the current branch has at least one commit ahead of the base branch.
- `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated.

**Expected behavior:**
1. Skill runs the six git shell blocks and stops with a clear message if any of: not a git repo, no remote, dirty working tree.
2. Skill resolves the base branch via the priority order (`--base` flag > `origin/HEAD` > `main` > `master` > `develop` > prompt).
3. Skill pushes the branch (`git push` with upstream, otherwise `git push -u origin <branch>`).
4. Skill builds a title (≤72 chars, imperative mood) and a body whose depth scales with PR size, prints both to chat (body in a fenced block), then asks via `AskUserQuestion` with a one-line question and `Create PR / Create as Draft / Edit / Cancel`.
5. With `--draft`, skill skips the prompt and runs `gh pr create --draft …`.
6. Final output shows the PR URL parsed from `gh` stdout.

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] Slash menu shows `/create-pr`.
- [ ] Skill stops cleanly with a single explanatory line on `NO_GIT`, `NO_REMOTE`, dirty tree, base-branch ambiguity, or zero commits ahead.
- [ ] Body uses HEREDOC formatting in the actual `gh pr create` invocation.
- [ ] Title and body are in English even when the conversation is in another language, and the body keeps its `## Summary` / section structure instead of one prose paragraph.
- [ ] The full body is visible in the chat stream before the prompt appears; the `AskUserQuestion` question is a single short line containing no body text.
- [ ] No AI-attribution lines appear in the title or body.
- [ ] `--base <branch>` overrides every other base-branch source.

**Known gotchas:**
- The `AskUserQuestion` question field is rendered single-line and truncated on some surfaces, and ANSI escape codes print literally (`\x1b[2m` shows up as `@[2m`). Keep the question to one short plain-text line and put the preview in the chat stream.
- `gh pr create` exits non-zero when a PR already exists; the skill must surface the error and suggest `gh pr list --head <branch>` rather than retrying.
- Bitbucket and Azure DevOps are not supported by `gh`; the user must run a platform-specific tool manually for those.
