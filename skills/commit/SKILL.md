# Instructions

## Step 0 -- Git Availability

If any gather-context block above returned `NO_GIT`, this directory is not a git repository.
Print: `> No git repository detected. /commit requires a git repo.`
**Stop here.**

---

Silently determine which case applies — do not show the case label or decision logic to the user:

- **No changes:** If `git status` is empty → tell the user and stop.
- **Nothing staged:** If `git diff --cached` is empty but `git status` shows changes → tell the user to stage files and run `/quiver:commit` again, then stop.
- **Staged changes exist:** Proceed silently to Commit Message Generation.

---

# Commit Message Generation

Analyze `git diff --cached` and the recent log. Generate a Conventional Commits message following these rules:

**Type** — Select one based on primary intent:

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | New feature or capability visible to users |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only (README, comments, JSDoc) |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace, semicolons — no logic change |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring with no behavior change |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or fixing tests |
| `build` | Build system or external dependencies (npm, Makefile) |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration (GitHub Actions, CircleCI) |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks (version bumps, tooling config) |
| `revert` | Reverting a previous commit |

**Scope** — From file paths: single directory → its name, single file → domain name, cross-cutting → omit.

**Breaking changes** — If the change removes/renames public APIs, changes signatures, alters data formats, or removes CLI flags/commands, add `!` after type/scope and a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

**Subject line** — Imperative mood, lowercase after colon, no period, ≤72 chars total, describe *what* not *how*.

**Body** — Almost never. Only for breaking changes or when the subject alone would be misleading. Wrap at 72 chars. Never include file lists — `git log --stat` shows this.

**Footers** — `BREAKING CHANGE:` if applicable. `Refs: #issue` if relevant.

---

# Output

**Important:** Do NOT output the commit message as separate text. Embed it directly inside the `AskUserQuestion` tool call so the user always sees the message alongside the options.

Include a body or footers only for breaking changes or multi-type changes where the subject alone is genuinely ambiguous. Default to subject-only. Don't add `Co-authored-by` or attribution footers unless explicitly requested.

## Flag: `--push`

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains "push" (e.g., `/quiver:commit --push`), skip the `AskUserQuestion` step entirely. Instead, show the generated commit message, then immediately execute **Commit & Push** (commit + push to remote) without prompting.

## Default (no flag)

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool with the commit message embedded in the question field:

- **Question:** Build the question string using this template (replace placeholders):\

`"Commit Message:\n\n{type}({scope}): {subject}\n\nProceed?"`

  Plain text only -- no ANSI escape codes. `AskUserQuestion` renders the question in a TUI box that prints escape sequences literally instead of styling them.

  If the message has a body, append body lines after the subject separated by newlines.
- **Header:** "Action"
- **Options:**
  1. **Commit** — "Commit with this message"
  2. **Commit & Push** — "Commit and push to remote"
  3. **Edit** — "Revise the message"
  4. **Cancel** — "Abort without committing"

---

# Commit Execution

**On commit or commit & push:**

1. Commit using a HEREDOC:
   ```
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   {full commit message}
   EOF
   )"
   ```
2. Verify: `git log --oneline -1` and `git status --short`.

**If commit & push**, also:

3. Detect branch: `git branch --show-current`
4. Push: if `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{upstream} 2>/dev/null` succeeds → `git push`, otherwise → `git push -u origin {branch}`
5. Verify push exit code is 0.

**Output:**

> **Committed:** `{short hash}` {subject}
> **Branch:** `{branch name}`
> **Pushed to:** `origin/{branch}` *(only if pushed)*

**On edit:** Ask what to change, revise, re-present, and ask again.

**On cancel:**

> **Commit cancelled.** Staged changes are intact.

**Stop here.**

# Error Handling

If `git commit` fails, show the error verbatim and suggest the user fix the issue and re-run `/quiver:commit`. Never retry automatically or use `--no-verify`.

---

## Test Plan

**Trigger:** `/commit` or `/commit --push` (and `/quiver:commit` should also work)

**Setup:**
- Current directory is a git repo with at least one staged change (`git diff --cached` is non-empty).

**Expected behavior:**
1. Skill runs the four git shell blocks; on a non-git directory it prints `> No git repository detected. /commit requires a git repo.` and stops.
2. With nothing changed, skill tells the user there's nothing to commit. With unstaged-only changes, skill tells the user to stage first.
3. With staged changes, skill drafts a Conventional Commits message (type/scope/subject) and presents it via `AskUserQuestion` with `Commit / Commit & Push / Edit / Cancel`.
4. With `--push` argument, skill skips the prompt and runs commit then push (`git push` if upstream exists, `git push -u origin <branch>` otherwise).
5. On failure, skill shows the error verbatim and exits without retrying or adding `--no-verify`.

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] Slash menu shows `/commit`.
- [ ] Generated commit message starts with a valid type (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, etc.) and a subject ≤72 chars.
- [ ] No `Co-authored-by` or AI-attribution footers appear in the commit.
- [ ] The interactive prompt is an `AskUserQuestion` with the message embedded in the question, not plain text.
- [ ] `--push` path commits and pushes without prompting.

**Known gotchas:**
- Pushing without an upstream requires `git push -u origin <branch>`; do not silently fall back to `git push` when no upstream is configured.
